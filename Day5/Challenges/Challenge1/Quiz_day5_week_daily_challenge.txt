What is a class?
A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.
What is an instance?
An instance, also known as an object, is a specific realization of a class. It represents a single, unique occurrence of the class.
What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).
It hides the internal state of objects and restricts direct access to them from outside the class.
What is abstraction?
Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
It allows for the creation of user-defined data types in the form of classes, where users only need to know how to use the class
without understanding its internal workings.
What is inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (derived class or subclass) is created from an existing class (base class or superclass),
inheriting its attributes and methods. It promotes code reusability and allows for the extension and modification of existing classes.
What is multiple inheritance?
Multiple inheritance is a feature in some object-oriented programming languages, including Python, where a class can inherit attributes and methods
from more than one base class. This allows for the creation of complex class hierarchies but can lead to ambiguity if the same method or attribute
is defined in multiple base classes.
What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to behave differently
based on the object they are called on, facilitating code flexibility and extensibility.
What is method resolution order or MRO?
Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which a programming language searches for methods and attributes in a class hierarchy.
In Python, the MRO is determined using the C3 linearization algorithm, and it defines the sequence in which base classes are searched
when a method or attribute is accessed from a derived class.
